The main idea of our project is to create a web application for wishlists creation. On _pinata.itmo.xyz_, users can create their own lists of desired gifts by providing information about them, photos of preferred items, or links to the shop's website where everyone can buy these gifts. Each registered user can have different wishlists at the same time. For example, user can create different lists for friends, relatives, or colleagues. Each wishlist has a unique ID number that user can share with other people who are not even registered on the website.

The aim of our project is to provide people with a convenient platform for fulfilling their wishes. We want everyone to receive only pleasant surprises and desired gifts.

Used technologies: git, python, flask, mongodb, nginx, html, css, js, bootstrap, certbot, photoshop
